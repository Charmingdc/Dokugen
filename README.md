# Dokugen: Your README Automation Superhero ðŸ¦¸

## Project Description

Dokugen is a CLI tool designed to automatically generate high-quality README files for your projects, saving you valuable time and effort. It intelligently analyzes your project structure and code to create comprehensive and professional documentation, allowing you to focus on building awesome software.

## Features

*   **Automated README Generation:** Dokugen analyzes your project files and generates a well-structured README.md file.
*   **Project Type Detection:**  It automatically detects the project type (e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go) based on the presence of specific files (e.g., `package.json`, `go.mod`).
*   **Code Snippet Extraction:**  Extracts relevant code snippets from your project files to include in the README.
*   **Interactive Configuration:** Asks key questions about your project (e.g., API usage, database integration, Docker setup) to tailor the README content.
*   **Customizable Output:** Allows you to specify whether to include sections on API endpoints, database setup, and Docker integration.
*   **Overwrite Protection:**  Prompts before overwriting an existing `README.md` file.
*   **Error Handling:** Provides informative error messages and gracefully handles interruptions.
