## Installation

To install Dokugen, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:

```bash
npm install -g dokugen
```

## Usage

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

```bash
dokugen generate
```

The tool will scan your project, ask a few questions to tailor the README, and generate a `README.md` file for you. If a `README.md` file already exists, you'll be prompted to overwrite it.
